## Instructions

Create a new repository in GitHub called `Building-a-Wireframe`. Clone this repository to your computer. 
Navigate to the `Building-a-Wireframe` folder you just cloned onto your machine. Then create two files inside this folder: `index.html` and `style.css`. 

**Make your initial Git commit and push it to GitHub.**

1. git add .
2. git commit -m "comment"
3. git push origin master

If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in your repository. This will be your initial test to confirm that you're hooked into GitHub. Return to your local copies of `index.html` and `style.css`. Using the screenshot at the top of these instructions, recreate the design using HTML/CSS.
